Warp supports multiple languages to make working with data smoother. The language can be configured in Warp's settings screen (reachable through the 'Warp' menu in the top menu bar). The selected language influences the following aspects of Warp:

* The way numbers are formatted (thousands and decimal separator)
* The way values are separated in formulas
* The names of functions and constants in formulas

When loading data, a language can be selected using which the data should be interpreted. This language is by default the same language as is selected for Warp.

The following table lists the most important parameters of the currently supported languages.

| Aspect | English | Dutch |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Decimal separator | . | , |
| Thousands separator | , | . |
| Value separator | ; | ; |
